	 * Connection callbacks class.
	 * 
	 * When Google Play Game Services events occur, these delegates are called
	 * 
	 * Be warned, that they might happen on any thread, so if you want to do 
	 * something with Unity (for example access PlayerPrefs), you need to do that on
	 * a main thread.
	 * 
	 * In practice you should use a tool like Loom (http://unitygems.com/threads/)
	 * like this:
	 * 
	 *    client.callbacks.OnConnected += onConnection;
	 * 
	 *    protected void onConnection() {
	 *      Debug.Log("Connected to highscores service.");
	 *      Loom.QueueOnMainThread(() => {
	 *        PlayerPrefs.SetInt("foo", 10);
	 *      });
	 *    }
	 *    
	 * Be sure to initialize Loom in one of your scripts, in Awake() or Start() methods:
	 * 
	 *    Debug.Log(Loom.Current); // Initialize Loom
